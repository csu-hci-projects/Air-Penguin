### Product Description
This project focuses on the ability to identify places of importance using Augmented Reality while in the air for pilots. The pilot or co-pilot will open up the program on their android and would use the camera and pan around to the location based marker on the screen. After using the program and landing, the pilot will fill out a survey describing the usability and performance of the program as well as any potential improvements to be made. The results will be recorded by the researcher for further development of the prototype.
