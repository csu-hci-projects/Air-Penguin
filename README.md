# Air-Penguin

### Author - Daniel de Paz

### Product Description
This project focuses on the ability to identify places of importance using Augmented Reality while in the air for pilots. The pilot or co-pilot will open up the program on their android and would use the camera and pan around to the location based marker on the screen. After using the program and landing, the pilot will fill out a survey describing the usability and performance of the program as well as any potential improvements to be made. The results will be recorded by the researcher for further development of the prototype.

### Required Assets
#### LAR Location Augmented Reality v0.4
#### Native GPS Plugin v1.1.0
#### Native Toolkit v1.2

### NOTE:
3/27 - Current prototype needs to be started while on the ground at Centenial Airport. The altitude of the location objects is being affected by the initial altitude of the user at startup. This bug was found during flight.
